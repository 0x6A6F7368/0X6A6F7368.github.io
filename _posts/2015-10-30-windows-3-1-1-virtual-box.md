For a bit of fun I thought I would run Windows 3.1.1 in a Virtual Box.

Although I spent my early days mucking around on MSDOS, I do remember coming across Windows 3.1.1 on some old machines I was dismantling as a kid.

I really do like the simple GUI, it&#8217;s just nice to look at. Just takes you back.
