The holiday season is quickly approaching &#8211; during which, many of us will visit (or be visited by) family and friends. If you&#8217;re employed in any role that involves using a computer you will no doubt be bombarded with technical questions over the silly season.

This is just a few simple tasks I&#8217;ve put together to help family and friends have a better computing experience and be more secure &#8211; and possibly save you from having to remove the same junkware from their machine again next holidays.

## Windows

  * **Remove the junk**: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank">AdwCleaner</a> seams to clean up most of the rubbish that users manage to install. It is offered for free by Malwarebytes.
  * **Run Disk-Cleanup:** If it hasn&#8217;t been done for a while, it will free up quite a bit of disk space.
  * **Ensure operating system is up to date**: No doubt there will be many friends or family members saying their computer &#8220;isn&#8217;t going to work&#8221; after January. Time to upgrade to Windows 10. If Windows 10 is out of their price range check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Ubuntu (opens in a new tab)" href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> (Or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Lubuntu (opens in a new tab)" href="https://lubuntu.net/" target="_blank">Lubuntu</a> for older hardware).
  * **Install <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> (If you are Privacy conscious maybe look at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a>).** 
  * **Install <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock" target="_blank">uBlock Origin</a> & <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere" target="_blank">HTTPS Everywhere</a>**
  * **Modify the HOSTS file using the HOST file from <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/" target="_blank">someonewhocares</a>:** It might break the advertising links at the top of a Google search if this is going to be a problem.
  * **Ensure AV is up to date**: Use a paid AV if possible (I recommend <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eset.com/" target="_blank">ESET</a>) If paid is not possible ensure Windows Defender is enabled on Windows 10.
  * **Create a new Administrator account**: and set the main user as a Standard user. Don&#8217;t keep the password to yourself, otherwise you will get many phone calls from your family and friends every time they need to change a setting. Running as a standard users prevents malware or other nasties from running as administrator as they stealthily try to execute in the background.

## MacOS

  * **Install latest patches for macOS:** If device is too old and slow (or running an unsupported OS) consider installing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lubuntu.net/" target="_blank">Lubuntu</a>.
  * **Install <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> (If you are Privacy conscious maybe look at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a>).** 
  * **Install <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock" target="_blank">uBlock Origin</a> & <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere" target="_blank">HTTPS Everywhere</a>**
  * **Create a new Administrator account**: and set the main user as a Standard user. Don&#8217;t keep the password to yourself, otherwise you will get many phone calls from your family and friends every time they need to change a setting. Running as a standard users prevents malware or other nasties from running as administrator as they stealthily try to execute in the background.
  * If using a Mac ensure the inbuilt firewall is enabled.

## iOS

**Turn on Passcode or Face ID:** Settings > Touch ID & Passcode (Face ID & Passcode) > Turn Passcode On. 

**Turn on Automatic Updates for iOS:** Settings > General > Software Update > Automatic Updates = On.



## Android



## Passwords

**Talk about Passwords:** Yes Passwords suck, but sucky passwords suck more. Teach them about diceware. Need a gift idea? <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.dicewarepasswords.com/shop/" target="_blank">Buy a family member a diceware password</a>. Help to setup a password manager. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://keepassxc.org/" target="_blank">KeePassXC</a> works well, and I have had many clients find <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank">1Password</a> nice and easy to use.

Help configure 2FA &#8211; You probably don&#8217;t want to setup up all their accounts with 2FA but perhaps start with important things like email and banking. If you have a tech savvy friend or family member perhaps a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="YubiKey (opens in a new tab)">YubiKey</a> would be a good gift.

If I have missed anything feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@joshdawes.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let me know</a> and I&#8217;ll add it!
