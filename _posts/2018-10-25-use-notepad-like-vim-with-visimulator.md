If you come from a *nix environment, you would at some stage used Vi or Vim. Some people love it, some people hate it. While I am not a Vim power user, I do find the keyboard shortcuts come in very handy.

On Windows my editor of choice is Notepad ++. As the name suggests it is a &#8220;plus&#8221; version of Windows Notepad. I won’t go into details of Notepad ++ here, but you can visit their <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> to find out more.

To make Notepad ++ feel more like Vim we can install the plugin, ViSimulator. This can be enabled via the Plugins menu.

From the **Plugins** menu navigate to **Plugin Manager** & click **Show Plugin Manager**.

Scroll down the list until you see **ViSimulator for Notepad ++**. Tick the box and then click **install**.

Notepad ++ will require and restart, follow the prompts to restart now.

Once Notepad ++ restarts you can now enable ViSimulator.

To do this Click the **Plugins** Menu, navigate to **ViSimulator**, and then click on **Enable ViSimulator**.

You can now use Vim commands in Notepad ++

Don’t worry you can still quit the program by clicking the X!
