At an elevated Command Prompt/PowerShell type **diskpart**. This will bring up diskpart utility. Diskpart allows you to manage disks, partitions, and volumes. Diskpart is ready when you can see **DISKPART>** on the Command Prompt/PowerShell window. We can now repartition and format the hard drive.

  * Select the disk by typing **select disk** **3** or whatever number corresponds with your drive.
  * Type **list partition** to view the current partitions. Make note of theÂ  partition/s you wish to remove. i.e. partition 1.
  * To remove a partition first type **select partition 1**, or whatever number corresponds with the partition you wish to remove.
  * Delete the partition by typing **delete partition**. This will remove the currently selected partition. Repeat for multiple partitions.
  * Create a new partition by typing **create partition primary**. Your new partition is created and ready to format.
  * Format the partition by typing **format fs=ntfs label=&#8221;Local Disk&#8221;**. The drive will now be formatted. If you requrie a qucik format you can type **format fs=ntfs label=&#8221;Local Disk&#8221; quick**
